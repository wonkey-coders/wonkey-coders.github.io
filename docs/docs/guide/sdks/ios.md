## The 'iOS' Target

Wonkey requires [Apple Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to build apps for iOS.

## Building an iOS app

1. Build your app inside Wide using 'Build -> Build Only' with 'Build Target -> iOS' selected.

2. Open the generated Xcode project (at myapp.products/iOS/) and run it.
