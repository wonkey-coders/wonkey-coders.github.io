# Emscripten

## The 'emscripten' Target

Wonkey uses the emscripten sdk compilers and tools to build wasm and asm.js apps.

<!--

For 64 bit windows, there is an experimental emscripten sdk download available<br>at: [monkeycoder.co.nz/monkey2-files](http://monkeycoder.co.nz/monkey2-files/).

For all other desktop targets, you will need to install emscripten yourself.<br>More info here: [github.com/juj/emsdk/README.md](https://github.com/juj/emsdk/blob/master/README.md).

You will also need the mserver ('mini server') app if you want to be able to launch emscripten apps from Wide.<br>This can also be downloaded from [monkeycoder.co.nz/monkey2-files](http://monkeycoder.co.nz/monkey2-files/).
