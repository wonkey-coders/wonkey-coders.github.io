# Enum

## Introduction

An enum is a user defined data type that contains a set of named integer constants. Enums are frequently used to implement typesafe 'flags' or 'bitmasks'.

Unintialized enum members are automatically assigned constant integer values starting with 0 and increasing by 1 for each successive enum member:

```monkey
Enum MyEnum
    A,B,C ' A, B, C will be assigned the values 0, 1, 2
    D,E,F ' D, E, F will be assigned the values 4, 5, 6
End
```

You can also initialize enum members with a constant integer value:

```monkey
Enum MyEnum
    A=10,B=20,C=30 ' A, B, C will be assigned the values 10, 20, 30
    D,E,F          ' D, E, F will be assigned the values 31, 32, 33
End
```

Enum members are accessed using the 'dot' operator:

```monkey
Local e:MyEnum = MyEnum.A
```

Enum values can be implictly converted to any integer type, and can be used with the **`&`** (bitwise 'and'), **`|`** (bitwise 'or') and **`~`** (bitwise 'exclusive-or') binary operators.
 This allows you to use enums to represent 'bitmasks'.

Enum values can also be compared with enum values of the same type, or with a **`Null`** which represents an enum value with the integer value 0.
