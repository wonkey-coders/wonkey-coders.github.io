# Variant

## Introduction

A Variant is a special value that can be used to 'box' values of any other type.

The easiest way to create a variant is to cast a value to Variant (much like casting an Int to String etc), eg:

`Local v := Variant( 10 )`

An uninitialized variant will contain a 'null' value (of type Void) until you assign something to it:

```monkey
Local v:Variant
v = 10      ' variant now contains an int 10.
v = "hello" ' variant now contains a string "hello".
```

A variant is true if it is initialized (even if it contains a bool 'false' value) and false if it is uninitialized. There is currently no way to uninitialize a variant, so once a variant is initialized it will always be 'true'.

Any type of value can be implicitly converted to a variant, so you can easily pass anything to a function with variant parameters:

```monkey
Function Test( v:Variant )
End

Function Main()
    Test( 1 )
    Test( "Hello" )
    Test( New Int[] )
    Test( Main )
End
```

To retrieve the value contained in a variant, you must explicitly cast the variant to the desired type:

```monkey
Local v := Variant( 100 )
Print Cast<Int>( v )
```

Note that the cast must specify the exact type of the value already contained in the variant, or a runtime error will occur:

```monkey
Local v := Variant( 10 )
Print Cast<String>( v ) ' Runtime error! Variant contains an Int not a String!
```

The one exception to this is if the variant contains a instance of an object, in which case you can cast the variant to any valid base class of the object's actual type.
