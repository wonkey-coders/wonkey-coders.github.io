# Expressions

## Introduction

An expression is a sequence of operations that produces a result.

Expressions are formed by combining operators with operands, with the operands themselves being expression (often known as 'sub-expressions').

All expressions have a 'type', for example, the type of the expression '5' is 'Int'. The type of an expression depends on the type of its operands.
